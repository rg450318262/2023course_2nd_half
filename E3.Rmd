# Problem 20 *[9 points]*

In this problem, you will apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to mol.csv. See Sect. 12.2.4 of ISLR_v2.
When computing PCA on the data, omit the columns parentspecies and pSat_Pa, and scale the other variables to zero mean and unit variance unless otherwise instructed.

## Problem 20: Task a

### Question

Compute and show a PCA projection of the data into two dimensions.
Indicate the parent species (column parentspecies) by the pointâ€™s colour and shape. Remember to include a legend that indicates which colour/shape corresponds to which class.
What does the plot imply about the relationship between parentspecies and the other variables?

### My answer

## Problem 20: Task b

### Question

Plot (or report in a table) the proportion of variance explained (PVE), and the cumulative PVE for the principal components for scaled and unscaled data.
Why does it seem that fewer components explain a large proportion of the variance for unscaled data compared to the scaled data?

### My answer
